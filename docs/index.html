        <h3>Keeping things simple since 1988.</h3>
        <p>In a world moving fast I try to keep things simple. Making sense of complexity in digital products and creating simple and easy understandable design solutions. That’s is my goal. </p>
        <p>I bring expertise and knowledge in variety of fields such as product design, user interface design, prototyping, design thinking, user experience design and visual design. I am glad that I have given a opportunity to work with such companies as TWINO, Lattelecom and freelance variaty of scale side projects for Sonarworks, Aelita Leto etc.</p>
        <p>I believe if you look beyond the limits of your profession you will find the needed inspiration and answers. Do not afraid by experimenting. Challenge yourself and you will surprised about the outcome.</p>
